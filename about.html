											<h1>Annette Elizabeth Hilton, PhD<br />
											</h1>
											
										</header>
										<p>I am presently a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow (NSF STEM Ed IPRF), working at UC Davis in the Center for Community and Citizen Science. I collaborate with the non-profit Land Together to provide citizen science opportunities for currently incarcerated individuals, and study the  motivation and science identity of the participants.</p>

										<p>I hold a PhD from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I studied hydrology and water resources. I earned my bachelors degree (BA) in Geology from The College of Wooster (2017), where I conducted climate research using tree-ring analysis as well as remote sensing to observe water quality in the San Francisco Bay. During my undergraduate, I completed internships with the American Museum of Natural History and the NASA Student Airborne Research Program. </p>
										<p> Prior to coming to UC Santa Barbara, I spent two years as a science communications specialist for Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), where I ran the internal newsletter and authored over 60 articles on scientists and their research.</p>

										<p>During my time as a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara, I spent many years contributing to my department and campus community. I was the lead STEM mentor for all undergraduate research programs through the Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships (CSEP) on UC Santa Barbara campus (2023 - 2024). Continuing my work in science communicaion, I served as an American Geophysical Union (AGU) Voices for Science Fellow (2022 - 2023), and was the UC Santa Barbara Grad Slam Champion (2023). 


										<p>In addition to my scientific background, I have many years of experience and enjoyment in music and theatre. I enjoy combining art, writing, science, and community in my academic pursuits.</p>
